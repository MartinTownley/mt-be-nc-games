# Northcoders House of Games API

## Requirements for running the project locally

This project depends on two files that you need to create locally in the root of your project. These files will create the environment variables necessary for the development and testing of the application.

1. ".env.development" – please add the text "PGDATABASE=nc_games" to this file.
2. ".env.test" - please add the text "PGDATABASE=nc_games_test" to this file.

Finally, check that these files are git-ignored.
